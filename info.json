Can't fathom driving a car around your map, avoiding cliffs and lakes? Do you just want to get there already?\n\nWhat if you could simply open a dialog by **right-clicking** on the map view and teleport immediately to that location?\n\nMaybe you have been stymied by having to go through multiple steps just to create a map tag? Now you can **right-click** and create your tag. That's it!"
