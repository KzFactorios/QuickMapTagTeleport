# Quick Map Tag Teleport

**_And you may find yourself in another part of the world..._**


Tired of walking and running your game-time-life away? 
Can't fathom driving a car around your map, avoiding cliffs and lakes? 
Don't you just want to get there already?

What if you could simply open a dialog by **right-clicking** on the map view and teleport immediately to that location? 

Maybe you have been stymied by having to go through multiple steps just to create a map tag? 
Simply **right-click** and create your tag. That's it!

The Favorites Bar:
Left-click on the heart to show/hide the favorites bar 
Left-click or ctrl+# on a numbered location to teleport
Right-click on a favorite to edit location

NOT YET TESTED FOR MULTIPLAYER
* although the only issue you may run into is uninstalling and I plan to conquer that soon.
