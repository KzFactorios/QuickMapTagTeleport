    - Those locations correspond to ctrl-# activated hotkey
    - Click on the heart to open/close the favorites bar
    - To change location of the hotkey, right-click on the favorite and use the arrows to move it

    - Fixed bug when trying to update position on tag update from stock editor

  TODO:
    - code cleanup
    - Edit favorite should allow favorite checkbox and delete capability (move?)
    - Moving a fave (on fav_bar) should have two modes: 1) keep position and 2) (current) move to next open spot
    - On teleport, remain in chart view (toggle). Make this a preference setting ** more research needed - side effects
    - Raise events for Modified, Added, Deleted to mod events
    - When a location is deleted from the stock editor, those changes are reflected in the favorites
