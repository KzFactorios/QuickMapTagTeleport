Date: 2024-12-27

  Changes:
    - Added the concept of favorites to the mod
    - There is now a favorites bar at the top to hold up to 10 favorite locations per surface
    - Those locations correspond to ctrl-# activated hotkey
    - Click on the heart to open/close the favorites bar
    - To change location of the hotkey, right-click on the favorite and use the arrows to move it
    - Yes, in this mod, right-clicking is often your friend :)

    - When a location is edited or deleted from the stock editor, those changes are reflected in the favorites
    - Fixed bug when trying to update position on tag update from stock editor

  TODO:
    - Edit favorite should allow edit of favorite, icon and delete. (move?)
    - On teleport, remain in chart view (toggle) ** more research needed - side effects
    - Raise events for Modified, Added, and Deleted to mod events
    - Guis should handle ESC key hits properly
